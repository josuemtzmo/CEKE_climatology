\section{Introduction}

Ocean currents are highly anisotropic and include coherent vortices and meandering jets. While coherent vortices (recirculating currents) are approximated as ellipses with axes smaller than the Rossby radius of deformation ($R_D$), meandering jets are narrow but elongated currents. The anisotropic nature of these features translates in ...


% %	Oceans are fundamental in the regulation of the climate system, as they have the capacity to absorb and transport heat, carbon, and other tracers through diverse flow scales which range from planetary (thermohaline circulation) to microscopic scales (turbulence). Mesoscale processes (hundreds of kilometres in scale) explain most of the temporal variability of kinetic energy (KE) and transport of tracers in the oceans. KE associated with mesoscale variability is commonly used as a diagnostic of the ocean state from satellite observations and numerical simulations.  
% %	
% %	Mean KE indicates regions in the ocean with persistent large scale circulation \citep{}, while the temporal variability of the KE field are directly linked to many transitory process in the ocean: coherent vortices, meanders, and waves. Transient events are strongly dependent to surface forcing and mixed layer variability \citep{}. 
% %	
% %	The transient component of the variability includes seasonal, inter-annual, and decadal variability \citep{}. 
% %	
% %	It has been reported an significant increase of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the Southern Ocean \citep{}, 
% %	
% %	
% %	Add something here
% %	however the spatial variability is still unknown. 
% %	
% %	Despite satellite observations being coarser than 0.25$^\circ$ in many areas of the ocean, and a lack of studies exploring the global KE climatology, the present study will expands the understanding on surface ocean variability, and it is crucial  for ocean modeling community not only for ocean model validation, but also to  improve the eddy parametrization. 
% %	
% %	This study differs to \citet{Kang_On_2017} as we compute global climatologic focusing in the spatial distribution instead of the purely seasonality cycle.  The main goal of the present work is to generate a global climatology from the latest satellite observation dataset available, in order to complement the known information of the variability of the superficial Kinetic Energy.
% %	
% %	The data sources and methodology are described in section \ref{sec:Methods}. Global seasonality, inter-annual variability and trends are explored in sections \ref{sec:R_season},  \ref{sec:R_variability}, and  \ref{sec:R_trends} respectively. In section \ref{sec:R_regional} we present 3 regions in which we further investigate the temporal variability of kinetic energy and each of its components.
% %	
	\section{Methods}
	\label{sec:Methods}
% %	
% %	We compute global climatological montly KE, EKE, TEKE and TRKE by processing satellite observations and implementing TrackEddy an coherent eddy identification-reconstruction algorithm, with the capability to separate the Kinetic Energy from coherent and non-coherent features. The present study expands our understanding in the seasonal cycle, inter-annual variability and decadal trends.
% %	
% %	
% %	\subsection{Kinetic Energy decomposition}
% %	
% 	Kinetic energy is commonly divided into the mean and temporal variability components through a Reynolds decomposition. At a given time, the velocity field ($\mathbf{u}$) is split into the time mean ($\mathbf{\overline{u}}$) and time varying components ($\mathbf{u'}$). Additionally, as part of the climatology we also further decompose the eddy kinetic energy into the eddy kinetic energy contained by coherent features ($\mathbf{u'_e}$) and non-coherent ($\mathbf{u'_r}$). Therefore the KE equation can be written as:
	
% 	\begin{equation}
% 		\mathrm{KE}= \mathbf{\overline{u}}^2 +\underbrace{ \mathbf{u'_e}^2+ \mathbf{u'_r}^2 + \mathcal{O}^2}_{\mathbf{u'}^2}
% 	\end{equation}
	
% 	The second order terms ($\mathcal{O}$) are negligible as their time average is two orders of magnitude smaller than any other term. For more information about the decomposition of the field into coherent features and non-coherent features refer to \citet{Martinez_Kinetic_2019}.
% %	
% %	Qualitatively KE seasonality is similar to TKE and therefore we will focus mostly on the seasonality of TKE.

	    \label{fig:my_label}
	\end{figure}


% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item Western boundary currents show a strong seasonal patter, for example, the Kuroshio current maximum deviation from the mean occurs during the June-July-August (Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer), and lowest value during NH winter. Meanwhile, the Agulhas current at the Southern Hemisphere (SH) shows the opposite peak in the KE fields. This described phenomenology is similar to other western boundary currents.
% 		\item Gyres like the North Pacific Gyre (NPG), South Pacific Gyre (SPG), Indian Ocean Gyre (IOG) present a strong seasonal cycle. 
% 		\item The East Australian Current and the Leeuwin Current, Somali Current and East Indian Current show an intriguing dipole.
% 		\item The proposed TKE decomposition explains most of the regions in the ocean as a conjunction of Coherent processes (TEKE) and Non-coherent processes (TRKE). However, the Gulf of Tehuantepec (Mexico) shows that coherent processes dominate the regional TKE, as a direct response to the seasonal winds of the region (also shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tke_max_amp}).

% 		\label{fig:seasonal_global}
% 	\end{figure}
	
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item NH and SH ${\mathrm{TKE}}$, ${\mathrm{TEKE}}$, and ${\mathrm{TRKE}}$ show a clear seasonal cycle as the monthly means are not concentric to center.
% 		\item NH shows large values of ${\mathrm{TKE}}$, ${\mathrm{TEKE}}$, and ${\mathrm{TRKE}}$ during June-July, while the SH is intensified between January-February (i.e. Summer for both hemispheres).
% 		\item NH shows an overlay between the years of the record, meaning that the observed variability is intrinsic to the system, however the SH shows an increase for the monthly average since the beginning of the record. In other words, early years in the record have smaller magnitudes over the year than the recent years. 
% 		\item The progressive intensification of the ${\mathrm{TKE}}$, ${\mathrm{TEKE}}$, and ${\mathrm{TRKE}}$ magnitude suggest an increase in the seasonal amplitude and increasing trends in the SH [Consistent with \citet{Hogg_Recent_2015} and \citet{Martinez_Kinetic_2019}].
% 		\item ${\mathrm{TEKE}}$ is highly variable within a year cycle, and it also show a the strongest seasonal dependence as the monthly means are shifted further towards summer in both hemispheres.

% 	\begin{itemize}

% 		\item Lower tale in the NH presents a higher frequency. \textbf{Do you have any hypothesis for this?}
% 		\item The SH PDF has frequent larger magnitudes of ${\mathrm{TKE}}$, ${\mathrm{TEKE}}$, and ${\mathrm{TRKE}}$ during summer, than winter.

% 		\item \textbf{I personally thing this is an important plot to explain why we are showing only the first mode in the following plot. However, I'm not sure what else to describe or if I should only state the first to points within the text. Do you have any particular suggestion?}
% 		\item \textbf{An interesting feature can be observed in M$_2$ between 2016-2018, it will be cool to further investigate why, however I think the best is to leave it outside the discussion.}

% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item SO shows clusters with correlation values with the SAM index above $0.4$.

% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item Correlation between ENSO and  ${\mathrm{TKE}}$, ${\mathrm{TEKE}}$, and ${\mathrm{TRKE}}$ is larger than the correlation with SAM.
% 		\item \textbf{Is the anti-correlation at the ACC a consequence of a tele-connection with SAM?}

% 	\subsection{Trends}
% 	\label{subsec:R_trends}
	
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item Regions with increasing trends are significant over 95\%. Note that most of the SO shows increasing trends. It's still unknown the consequences of the intensification of the kinetic energy field, further research is required. 
% 		\item NH western boundary currents ${\mathrm{TKE}}$, ${\mathrm{TEKE}}$, and ${\mathrm{TRKE}}$ pole-wards. This could be attributed to their pole-wards shift. 
% 		\item Decreasing trends are insignificant over the current dataset record and are mostly located in the NH.
% 		\item Increasing trends in  ${\mathrm{TKE}}$ are a combination of the trends in ${\mathrm{TEKE}}$, and ${\mathrm{TRKE}}$.
% 		\item Particularly increasing trends can be found near Australia. The highest trend in the record is found near the Tasman Front. This is attributed to an intensification of the coherent eddy fiend that in this particular region has a larger trend than the residual field. This could be an effect of the strengthening of the coherent eddy generation from the East Australian Current. Further investigation is required.

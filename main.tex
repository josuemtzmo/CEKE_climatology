	Ocean eddies influence regional and global climate through mixing and transport of heat and properties. 
	One of the most recognizable and ubiquitous feature of oceanic eddies are vortices with spatial scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers, frequently referred as ``mesoscale eddies" or ``coherent eddies". 
	Coherent eddies are known to transport properties across the ocean and to locally affect near-surface wind, cloud properties and rainfall patterns. Although coherent eddies are ubiquitous, yet their climatology, seasonality and long-term temporal evolution remains poorly understood. 
	Thus, we examine the kinetic energy contained by coherent eddies and we present the annual, interannual, and long-term changes of automatically identified coherent eddies from satellite observations and a state of the art numerical simulation from 1993 to 2018. 
	Satellite observations show that around 40\% of the kinetic energy contained by ocean eddies corresponds to coherent eddies. 
	Additionally, a strong hemispherical seasonal cycle is observed, on top of a 3--6 months lag between the wind forcing and the response of the coherent eddy field. 
	Furthermore, the seasonality of the number of coherent eddies and their amplitude reveals that the number of coherent eddies responds faster to the forcing ($\sim$3 months), while the coherent eddy amplitude is lagged by $\sim$6 months.  
	There are regions that show a pronounced influence of coherent eddies, notably, the East Indian Ocean, the East Tropical Pacific Ocean, and the South Atlantic Ocean. 
	In these locations, a strong seasonal cycle and interannual variability can be observed in both satellite and numerical models. Although, there is agreement between these products on the seasonality of the number of eddies, the seasonality of the coherent eddy amplitude between these products show some inconsistencies. 
	Long-term trends of the coherent eddy amplitude from satellite observations and the state of the art model show significant increases in the eddy amplitude of $\sim$3cm per decade in large portions of the ocean, while the number of coherent eddies remains constant. 
	Our analysis highlight the relative importance of the coherent eddy fiend in the ocean kinetic energy budget, imply a strong response of the eddy number and eddy amplitude to the surface wind at different time-scales, and showcases for the first time seasonality, and multidecadal trends of the coherent eddy properties.

\section{Introduction}

Mesoscale ocean variability with spatial scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers is comprised by processes such as vortices, waves, and jets \citep{Ferrari_energy_2009, Wyrtki_Eddy_1976}. 
These mesoscale processes  


energetic scale in the ocean and plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, salt, momentum and other tracers through the ocean. In particularly, one of the most recognizable and abundant mesoscale process are vortices \citep{Abernathey_eddy_diffusivity_2013, Chelton_The_2011}.
Although, in literature mesoscale vortices are commonly refer as "mesoscale eddies", this term is often used to describe mesoscale ocean variability, thus, we will refer to coherent vortices as coherent eddies. 
Coherent eddies are circular currents in the ocean, they are ubiquitous in the oceans, and they 



Baroclinic generation \citep{Flierl_baroclinic_1980}


The term “mesoscale eddy” applied to a rotating coherent
structure of ocean currents that resembles an atmospheric storm,
generally refers to ocean signals with spatial scales from tens to
hundreds of kilometers and temporal scales from days to months
(Robinson, 2010). Eddies can be found nearly everywhere in the
world ocean (Abernathey and Marshall, 2013; Chelton et al.,
2011b), and they transport water, heat, salt, and energy as they
propagate in the ocean (Dong et al., 2014; Roemmich and Gilson,
2001; Thompson et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2011). Eddies also play a
significant role in transferring soluble carbon, chlorophyll, nutrients, and other tracers across the ocean, and have important influences on the marine ecosystem (Adams et al., 2011; Chelton et
al., 2011a; Gaube, 2013). By combining satellite altimetry and
Argo profiling float data, Zhang et al. (2014) found that eddy-induced zonal mass transport was comparable in magnitude to
that of the large-scale wind- and thermohaline-driven circulation.

In many previous studies, eddies have been treated as independent water bodies without consideration of eddy–eddy interaction. In fact, eddy–eddy interaction is universal within the
ocean (Trieling et al., 2005; Prants et al., 2011). Some studies for
eddy–eddy interaction have found plenty of multicore eddy
structures within the world ocean (Li and Sun, 2015; Trieling et al., 2005; Yi et al., 2015). Generally, multicore structures, which
have two or more closed eddies of the same polarity within their
boundaries, represent an important transitional stage in which
the component eddies might experience splitting, merging, or
other energy-transferring interactions. In studying eddy–eddy interaction processes, clear identification of multicore eddy structures is necessary. Chelton et al. (2011b) used a purely geometric
method that based on sea level anomaly (SLA) to identify the
global eddies, and recognized that recognized that their original
identification algorithm can yield eddies with more than one local extremum of SLA. Note that such multiple eddies are very
common in SLA data (Li and Sun, 2015; Wang et al., 2015), this
problem can occur when multiple eddies are physically close together. For these multiple eddies, Yi et al. (2015) presented a
Gaussian-surface-based approach to identify and characterize
the multicore structures of eddies from SLA datasets and results
of detecting dual-eddy structures in the South China Sea demonstrate the effectiveness of the identification approach.





Here we compute global climatology focusing in the spatial distribution instead of the purely seasonality cycle.  
The main goal of the present work is to generate a global climatology from the latest satellite observation dataset available, in order to complement the known information of the variability of the superficial Kinetic Energy. The data sources and methodology are described in section \ref{sec:Methods}. Global seasonality, inter-annual variability and trends are explored in sections \ref{sec:R_season},  \ref{sec:R_variability}, and  \ref{sec:R_trends} respectively. In section \ref{sec:R_regional} we present four regions in which we further investigate the temporal variability of kinetic energy and each of its components.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:Methods}
% %	
% %	We compute global climatological montly KE, EKE, TEKE and TRKE by processing satellite observations and implementing TrackEddy an coherent eddy identification-reconstruction algorithm, with the capability to separate the Kinetic Energy from coherent and non-coherent features. The present study expands our understanding in the seasonal cycle, inter-annual variability and decadal trends.

	\subsection{Kinetic Energy decomposition}

	Kinetic energy is commonly divided into the mean and temporal variability components through a Reynolds decomposition. At a given time, the velocity field ($\mathbf{u}$) is split into the time mean ($\mathbf{\overline{u}}$) and time varying components ($\mathbf{u'}$). Additionally, as part of the climatology we also further decompose the eddy kinetic energy into the eddy kinetic energy contained by coherent features ($\mathbf{u'_e}$) and non-coherent ($\mathbf{u'_n}$). Therefore the KE equation can be written as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\mathrm{KE}= \mathbf{\overline{u}}^2 +\underbrace{ \mathbf{u'_e}^2+ \mathbf{u'_n}^2 + \mathcal{O}^2}_{\mathbf{u'}^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	The second order terms ($\mathcal{O}$) are negligible as their time average is two orders of magnitude smaller than any other term. For more information about the decomposition of the field into coherent features and non-coherent features refer to \citet{Martinez_Kinetic_2019}.
% %	
% %	Qualitatively KE seasonality is similar to TKE and therefore we will focus mostly on the seasonality of TKE.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\MEKE$ is responsible of almost all the $\MKE$ across the ocean, except for regions with persistent currents over time, such as the mean boundary current locations, equatorial pacific currents and regions in the Antarctic Circumpolar current, where the EKE explains around 40\% of the $\MKE$
		\item $\MEKE$ Explains $~80\%$ of $\MKE$, while $\MCEKE$ is $~45\%$ of $\MEKE$ and $\MnCEKE$  is $~60\%$ of $\MEKE$ 
		\item $\MCEKE$ is large equatorwards from the Kuroshio current and Agulhas current.
		\item Areas with the largest coherent contribution are located in the South of Australia $\MCEKE$ and South Atlantic
		\item 
		\item $\MnCEKE$ has a large amount of energy at high latitudes, this could be a consequence of the satellites not resolving the mesoscale coherent eddies. 
		\item Global averages of the ratios show $\MEKE$ explains around 78\% of the ocean $MKE$ field, while coherent eddies and non coherent eddy features contain 49\% and 59\% per decade. Note this values don't add to 100\% as there are cross terms that contain around XX\% of the total energy.

		\item The hemisphere seasonality show the  $\EKE$ and $\CEKE$ peak in summer.
		\item Response of the $\EKE$ and $\CEKE$ show a seasonal lag of $\sim$6 months to the forcing of the Winds.
		\item The coherent eddy field show a large interannual variability.

	\subsection{Coherent Eddy Statistics}

	\subsubsection{Global}
	

	\textbf{Figure 4}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A comparison with previous identified numbers show a consistent pattern in the eddy count. The difference in the magnitude could be a consequence of \citet{Chelton_Global_2007} filtering the coherent eddies with lifespans longer than 16 weeks. 
		\item Both datasets show a large number of eddies in the East North Pacific, East North Atlantic, as well as the East South Pacific, East South Atlantic and East Indian Ocean. 
		\item While the number of eddies detected in the tropics is quite small.
		\item Furthermore, there are hotspots of numbers of eddies in other regions of the ocean, such as boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. 
		\item An interesting feature shown in both datasets is a predominant patchiness where the count of the eddies is much larger. These puzzling pattern remains unknown. Although it looks like a propagation pattern, it could be that eddies persist for longer in those areas.
		\item The eddy amplitude as expected is maximum at the boundary currents and hotspots in the southern ocean.
		\item Interior of the gyres we can observe that there is and important amplitude of the coherent eddy field. 
		\item Preferred eddy amplitude sign in boundary currents; positive amplitude polewards to the boundary current mean location, and negative amplitude equatorwards. This is consistent with the shed of coherent eddies from the boundary currents.
		\item There regions with large $\CEKE$ ratio show also a large coherent eddy amplitude.

	\subsubsection{Seasonality}

	\textbf{Figure 5}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Seasonality of the number of eddies in the Northern Hemisphere peaks on May, while the Southern Hemisphere peaks on October. 
		\item The seasonality of the amplitude of the eddies is consistent with those of the Coherent eddy kinetic energy. 
		\item Interestingly, there is a 3 month lag to between the winds and the seasonality of the number of eddies, while the eddy amplitude responds approximately 6 months after the maximum winds. 
		\item Note that both coherent eddy amplitudes seem to peak around the same time. 
		\item If we look closely, the growing-shrinking concentric circles correspond to an increasing-decreasing trend. These are particularly obvious as a decrease in the eddy number in the Southern Hemisphere, and a increase in the eddy amplitude.

	\textbf{Should we add the interannual variability of Chelton's?}

	Overall, we observe a polewards decrease in the number of the eddies. This supports the idea that the satellite observations are consistent with a continue dataset.

	\textbf{Figure 10}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The number and amplitude of coherent eddies from two eddy tracking algorithms show consistent trend patterns. 
		\item In particularly, we observe a decrease in the number of eddies in the southern ocean, as well as sectors in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. 
		\item Meanwhile the amplitude seems to be increasing in those same regions. 
		\item Some of these regions have undergone a readjustment to stronger winds, thus the observed trends in the eddy amplitude suggests an intensification of the coherent eddy field to an increase in the forcing.
		\item This increase is consistent with \citet{Martinez_Kinetic_2021}

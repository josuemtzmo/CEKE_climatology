	Ocean eddies influence regional and global climate through mixing and transport of heat and properties. One of the most recognizable and ubiquitous feature of oceanic eddies are vortices with spatial scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers, frequently referred as ``mesoscale eddies" or ``coherent eddies". Coherent eddies are known to transport properties across the ocean and to locally affect near-surface wind, cloud properties and rainfall patterns. Although coherent eddies are ubiquitous, yet their climatology, seasonality and long-term temporal evolution remains poorly understood. Thus, we examine the kinetic energy contained by coherent eddies and we present the annual, interannual, and long-term changes of automatically identified coherent eddies from satellite observations and a state of the art numerical simulation from 1993 to 2018. Satellite observations show that around 40\% of the kinetic energy contained by ocean eddies corresponds to coherent eddies. Additionally, a strong hemispherical seasonal cycle is observed, on top of a 3--6 months lag between the wind forcing and the response of the coherent eddy field. Furthermore, the seasonality of the number of coherent eddies and their amplitude reveals that the number of coherent eddies responds faster to the forcing ($\sim$3 months), while the coherent eddy amplitude is lagged by $\sim$6 months.  There are regions that show a pronounced influence of coherent eddies, notably, the East Indian Ocean, the East Tropical Pacific Ocean, and the South Atlantic Ocean. In these locations, a strong seasonal cycle and interannual variability can be observed in both satellite and numerical models. Although, there is agreement between these products on the seasonality of the number of eddies, the seasonality of the coherent eddy amplitude between these products show some inconsistencies. Long-term trends of the coherent eddy amplitude from satellite observations and the state of the art model show significant increases in the eddy amplitude of $\sim$3cm per decade in large portions of the ocean, while the number of coherent eddies remains constant. Our analysis highlight the relative importance of the coherent eddy fiend in the ocean kinetic energy budget, imply a strong response of the eddy number and eddy amplitude to the surface wind at different time-scales, and showcases for the first time seasonality, and multidecadal trends of the coherent eddy properties.

\section{Introduction}

Mesoscale ocean variability with spatial scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers is the most energetic scale in the ocean and comprises processes such as vortices, waves, and jets. In particularly, one of the most recognizable mesoscale process are vortices. Although, in literature mesoscale vortices are commonly refer as "mesoscale eddies", this term is often used to describe mesoscale ocean variability, thus, where we will use the term coherent eddy to refer to coherent vortices.

% Ocean eddies explain most of the temporal variability 


% of kinetic energy ($\KE$) and transport of tracers in the oceans. KE associated with mesoscale variability is commonly used as a diagnostic of the ocean state from satellite observations and numerical simulations.


% Ocean currents 

%Ocean currents are highly anisotropic and include coherent vortices and meandering jets. While coherent vortices (recirculating currents) are approximated as ellipses with axes smaller than the Rossby radius of deformation ($R_D$), meandering jets are narrow but elongated currents. The anisotropic nature of these features translates in ...


% %	Oceans are fundamental in the regulation of the climate system, as they have the capacity to absorb and transport heat, carbon, and other tracers through diverse flow scales which range from planetary (thermohaline circulation) to microscopic scales (turbulence). Mesoscale processes (hundreds of kilometres in scale) explain most of the temporal variability of kinetic energy (KE) and transport of tracers in the oceans. KE associated with mesoscale variability is commonly used as a diagnostic of the ocean state from satellite observations and numerical simulations.  
% %	
% %	Mean KE indicates regions in the ocean with persistent large scale circulation \citep{}, while the temporal variability of the KE field are directly linked to many transitory process in the ocean: coherent vortices, meanders, and waves. Transient events are strongly dependent to surface forcing and mixed layer variability \citep{}. 
% %	
% %	The transient component of the variability includes seasonal, inter-annual, and decadal variability \citep{}. 
% %	
% %	It has been reported an significant increase of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the Southern Ocean \citep{}, 
% %	
% %	
% %	Add something here
% %	however the spatial variability is still unknown. 
% %	
% %	Despite satellite observations being coarser than 0.25$^\circ$ in many areas of the ocean, and a lack of studies exploring the global KE climatology, the present study will expands the understanding on surface ocean variability, and it is crucial  for ocean modeling community not only for ocean model validation, but also to  improve the eddy parametrization. 
% %	
% %	This study differs to \citet{Kang_On_2017} as we compute global climatologic focusing in the spatial distribution instead of the purely seasonality cycle.  The main goal of the present work is to generate a global climatology from the latest satellite observation dataset available, in order to complement the known information of the variability of the superficial Kinetic Energy.
% %	
% %	The data sources and methodology are described in section \ref{sec:Methods}. Global seasonality, inter-annual variability and trends are explored in sections \ref{sec:R_season},  \ref{sec:R_variability}, and  \ref{sec:R_trends} respectively. In section \ref{sec:R_regional} we present 3 regions in which we further investigate the temporal variability of kinetic energy and each of its components.

	\section{Methods}
	\label{sec:Methods}
% %	
% %	We compute global climatological montly KE, EKE, TEKE and TRKE by processing satellite observations and implementing TrackEddy an coherent eddy identification-reconstruction algorithm, with the capability to separate the Kinetic Energy from coherent and non-coherent features. The present study expands our understanding in the seasonal cycle, inter-annual variability and decadal trends.

	\subsection{Kinetic Energy decomposition}

	Kinetic energy is commonly divided into the mean and temporal variability components through a Reynolds decomposition. At a given time, the velocity field ($\mathbf{u}$) is split into the time mean ($\mathbf{\overline{u}}$) and time varying components ($\mathbf{u'}$). Additionally, as part of the climatology we also further decompose the eddy kinetic energy into the eddy kinetic energy contained by coherent features ($\mathbf{u'_e}$) and non-coherent ($\mathbf{u'_n}$). Therefore the KE equation can be written as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\mathrm{KE}= \mathbf{\overline{u}}^2 +\underbrace{ \mathbf{u'_e}^2+ \mathbf{u'_n}^2 + \mathcal{O}^2}_{\mathbf{u'}^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	The second order terms ($\mathcal{O}$) are negligible as their time average is two orders of magnitude smaller than any other term. For more information about the decomposition of the field into coherent features and non-coherent features refer to \citet{Martinez_Kinetic_2019}.
% %	
% %	Qualitatively KE seasonality is similar to TKE and therefore we will focus mostly on the seasonality of TKE.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Figure 1 shows regions with high values of Kinetic Energy at the Western Boundary Currents, ACC, and ocean gyres. 
		\item $\MEKE$ Explains $~70\%$ of $\MKE$, while $\MCEKE$ is $~40\%$ of $\MEKE$ and $\MnCEKE$  is $~60\%$ of $\MEKE$ 
		\item Maps show that $\MKE$, $\MEKE$, $\MCEKE$, and $\MnCEKE$ are dominated by the western boundary currents, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC).

	Note that \nCEKE has a large amount of energy at high latitudes, this could be a consequence of the satellites not resolving the mesoscale coherent eddies.

	\begin{figure}

	    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/global_stats_polarity.pdf}
	    \caption{Climatology of the coherent eddy statistics. a) Climatology of the number of coherent eddies ($\cEddy_n$) identified by \citet{Chelton_Global_2007}; b) Climatology of the warm core coherent eddy amplitude ($\cEddy_{amp}$). c) Climatology of the number of coherent eddies ($\cEddy_n$) identified by \citet{Martinez_Kinetic_2019}; d) Climatology of the cold core coherent eddy amplitude ($\cEddy_amp$).}
	    \label{fig:eddy_stats_climatology}
	\end{figure}

	Although these algorithms use different identification criteria, the spatial pattern of the number of eddies in consistent between them.

	The maximum positive coherent eddy amplitude is commonly located polewards of the mayor boundary currents, while the maximum negative coherent eddy amplitude is found equatorwards. This is consistent to how coherent eddies are shed from these boundary currents.

	Overall, we observe a polewards decrease in the number of the eddies. This supports the idea that the satellite observations are consistent with a continue dataset.

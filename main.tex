	Ocean eddies influence regional and global climate through mixing and transport of heat and properties. 
	One of the most recognizable and ubiquitous feature of oceanic eddies are vortices with spatial scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers, frequently referred as ``mesoscale eddies" or ``coherent eddies". 
	Coherent eddies are known to transport properties across the ocean and to locally affect near-surface wind, cloud properties and rainfall patterns. Although coherent eddies are ubiquitous, yet their climatology, seasonality and long-term temporal evolution remains poorly understood. 
	Thus, we examine the kinetic energy contained by coherent eddies and we present the annual, interannual, and long-term changes of automatically identified coherent eddies from satellite observations and a state of the art numerical simulation from 1993 to 2018. 
	Satellite observations show that around 40\% of the kinetic energy contained by ocean eddies corresponds to coherent eddies. 
	Additionally, a strong hemispherical seasonal cycle is observed, on top of a 3--6 months lag between the wind forcing and the response of the coherent eddy field. 
	Furthermore, the seasonality of the number of coherent eddies and their amplitude reveals that the number of coherent eddies responds faster to the forcing ($\sim$3 months), while the coherent eddy amplitude is lagged by $\sim$6 months.  
	There are regions that show a pronounced influence of coherent eddies, notably, the East Indian Ocean, the East Tropical Pacific Ocean, and the South Atlantic Ocean. 
	In these locations, a strong seasonal cycle and interannual variability can be observed in both satellite and numerical models. Although, there is agreement between these products on the seasonality of the number of eddies, the seasonality of the coherent eddy amplitude between these products show some inconsistencies. 
	Long-term trends of the coherent eddy amplitude from satellite observations and the state of the art model show significant increases in the eddy amplitude of $\sim$3cm per decade in large portions of the ocean, while the number of coherent eddies remains constant. 
	Our analysis highlight the relative importance of the coherent eddy fiend in the ocean kinetic energy budget, imply a strong response of the eddy number and eddy amplitude to the surface wind at different time-scales, and showcases for the first time seasonality, and multidecadal trends of the coherent eddy properties.

\section{Introduction}

Mesoscale ocean variability with spatial scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers is comprised by processes such as vortices, waves, and jets \citep{Ferrari_energy_2009, Fu_Eddy_2010}. 
These mesoscale processes are highly energetic, and they play a crucial role in the transport of heat, salt, momentum and other tracers through the ocean \citep{Wunsch_energetics_2004, Wyrtki_Eddy_1976, Gill_Energy_1974}. Possibly, the most recognizable and abundant process observed from satellites are mesoscale vortices. Although mesoscale vortices are commonly refer in literature as ``mesoscale eddies", this term is also often used to describe mesoscale ocean variability (time-varying component of flow), thus, here we will refer to mesoscale vortices as coherent eddies. 


Coherent eddies are circular currents and according to their rotational direction, the sea surface height anomaly within a coherent eddy can have a negative or positive sea surface height anomaly (cold core and warm core coherent eddies, respectively). 
This characteristic sea surface height signature of coherent eddies has been utilized to automatically identified and tracked coherent eddies from satellite altimetry \citep{Cui_eddy_identification_2020,Martinez_Kinetic_2019, Ashkezari_eddies_2016, Faghmous_A_2015,Chelton_Global_2007}. 
Automated identification algorithms of coherent eddies have shown their ubiquity in the oceans, with a predominant influence at hotpots of eddy activity such as boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar current. In these regions, \citet{Chelton_The_2011} estimated that coherent eddies contribute around 40--50\% of the mesoscale kinetic energy \citep{Chelton_The_2011} and thus a significant fraction of the total kinetic energy \citep{Ferrari_energy_2009}. Although this unique estimate showcases the importance of the mesoscale coherent eddy field, the energy contained by coherent eddies was estimated by extracting the the geostrophic velocities within the detected coherent eddies, thus it is possible it may contain energy from other processes. Coherent eddies are not only abundant and may have a large proportion of the surface kinetic energy budget, but they also are essential in the ocean dynamics as concluded by many previous studies \citep{Patel_SO_eddies_2020,Schubert_submesoscale_2019,Pilo_eddy_2015,Frenger_Southern_2015,Frenger_Imprint_2013,BeronVera_Agulhas_2013,Siegel_Bio_2011,Hogg_Interdecadal_2006}.


There is broad consensus that mesoscale eddy kinetic energy has a pronounced seasonal variability \citep{Uchida_Seasonality_2017,Kang_On_2017,Qiu_seasonal_2004, Qiu_seasonal_1999}, several hypothesis proposed to explain this include: seasonal variations of atmospheric forcing \citep{Sasaki_seasonal_2014}, seasonality of the mixed layer depth \citep{Qiu_seasonal_2014,Callies_season_2015}, seasonality in the intensity of barotropic instability \citep{Qiu_seasonal_2004}, variability of the baroclinic instability due to seasonality of the vertical shear \citep{Qiu_seasonal_1999}, and a seasonal lag of the inverse energy cascade (energy is transported between scales from small to large; \citealp{Arbic_cascade_2013}) in combination with the presence of a front in the mixed layer, which can lead to a seasonal cycle of the baroclinic instability \citep{Qiu_seasonal_2014}. All  these factors are likely to influence the seasonal cycle of coherent eddies, however the seasonality of the coherent component of the eddy kinetic energy, as well as the seasonal cycle of the coherent eddy statistics remains unknown.

% Front in ML, then frontal baroclinic instability
% Vertical Shear = Interior baroclinic instability.

On one hand, processes such as barotropic and baroclinic instabilities could control the seasonality of coherent eddies in the ocean. On the other hand, recent studies using observations and eddy-permitting climate models suggest several long term adjustments of the global ocean capable of longterm changes in the coherent eddy field. Such readjustments include a multidecadal increase in the ocean stratification resulted from temperature and salinity changes \citep{Li_stratification_2020}, a horizontal readjusment of the sea surface temperature gradients \citep{Ruela_SST_trends_2020,Bouali_SST_grad_trends_2017,Cane_SST_trends_1997}, and a intensification of the kinetic energy, eddy kinetic energy, and mesoscale eddy kinetic energy over the last 3 decades as a consequence of an increase in wind forcing \citep{Hu_acceleration_2020,Wunsch_speeding_2020,Martinez_Kinetic_2021}. This global trends readjustments are spatially heterogeneous, 


interannual response between wind forcing and the eddy response \citep{}.

an intensification of the ocean forcing and eddy kinetic energy \citep{Martinez_Kinetic_2021, Hogg_Recent_2015,Hughes_Wind_2008} could modify the mesoscale coherent eddy field in decadal timescales. 


Here we compute global climatology focusing in the spatial distribution instead of the purely seasonality cycle.  
The main goal of the present work is to generate a global climatology from the latest satellite observation dataset available, in order to complement the known information of the variability of the superficial Kinetic Energy. The data sources and methodology are described in section \ref{sec:Methods}. Global seasonality, inter-annual variability and trends are explored in sections \ref{sec:R_season},  \ref{sec:R_variability}, and  \ref{sec:R_trends} respectively. In section \ref{sec:R_regional} we present four regions in which we further investigate the temporal variability of kinetic energy and each of its components.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:Methods}
% %	
% %	We compute global climatological montly KE, EKE, TEKE and TRKE by processing satellite observations and implementing TrackEddy an coherent eddy identification-reconstruction algorithm, with the capability to separate the Kinetic Energy from coherent and non-coherent features.

	\subsection{Kinetic Energy decomposition}

	Kinetic energy is commonly divided into the mean and temporal variability components through a Reynolds decomposition. At a given time, the velocity field ($\mathbf{u}$) is split into the time mean ($\mathbf{\overline{u}}$) and time varying components ($\mathbf{u'}$). Additionally, as part of the climatology we also further decompose the eddy kinetic energy into the eddy kinetic energy contained by coherent features ($\mathbf{u'_e}$) and non-coherent ($\mathbf{u'_n}$). Therefore the KE equation can be written as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\mathrm{KE}= \mathbf{\overline{u}}^2 +\underbrace{ \mathbf{u'_e}^2+ \mathbf{u'_n}^2 + \mathcal{O}^2}_{\mathbf{u'}^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	The second order terms ($\mathcal{O}$) are negligible as their time average is two orders of magnitude smaller than any other term. For more information about the decomposition of the field into coherent features and non-coherent features refer to \citet{Martinez_Kinetic_2019}.

		\item $\MEKE$ is responsible of almost all the $\MKE$ across the ocean, except for regions with persistent currents over time, such as the mean boundary current locations, equatorial pacific currents and regions in the Antarctic Circumpolar current, where the EKE explains around 40\% of the $\MKE$
		\item $\MEKE$ Explains $~80\%$ of $\MKE$, while $\MCEKE$ is $~45\%$ of $\MEKE$ and $\MnCEKE$  is $~60\%$ of $\MEKE$ 
		\item $\MCEKE$ is large equatorwards from the Kuroshio current and Agulhas current.
		\item Areas with the largest coherent contribution are located in the South of Australia $\MCEKE$ and South Atlantic
		\item 
		\item $\MnCEKE$ has a large amount of energy at high latitudes, this could be a consequence of the satellites not resolving the mesoscale coherent eddies. 
		\item Global averages of the ratios show $\MEKE$ explains around 78\% of the ocean $MKE$ field, while coherent eddies and non coherent eddy features contain 49\% and 59\% per decade. Note this values don't add to 1 as there are cross terms that contain around XX\% of the total energy.

	\subsection{Coherent Eddy Statistics}

	\subsubsection{Global}
	

	\textbf{Figure 4}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A comparison with previous identified numbers show a consistent pattern in the eddy count. The difference in the magnitude could be a consequence of \citet{Chelton_Global_2007} filtering the coherent eddies with lifespans longer than 16 weeks. 
		\item Both datasets show a large number of eddies in the East North Pacific, East North Atlantic, as well as the East South Pacific, East South Atlantic and East Indian Ocean. 
		\item While the number of eddies detected in the tropics is quite small.
		\item Furthermore, there are hotspots of numbers of eddies in other regions of the ocean, such as boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. 
		\item An interesting feature shown in both datasets is a predominant patchiness where the count of the eddies is much larger. These puzzling pattern remains unknown. Although it looks like a propagation pattern, it could be that eddies persist for longer in those areas.
		\item The eddy amplitude as expected is maximum at the boundary currents and hotspots in the southern ocean.
		\item Interior of the gyres we can observe that there is and important amplitude of the coherent eddy field. 
		\item Preferred eddy amplitude sign in boundary currents; positive amplitude polewards to the boundary current mean location, and negative amplitude equatorwards. This is consistent with the shed of coherent eddies from the boundary currents.
		\item There regions with large $\CEKE$ ratio show also a large coherent eddy amplitude.

	\subsubsection{Seasonality}

	\textbf{Figure 5}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Seasonality of the number of eddies in the Northern Hemisphere peaks on May, while the Southern Hemisphere peaks on October. 
		\item The seasonality of the amplitude of the eddies is consistent with those of the Coherent eddy kinetic energy. 
		\item Interestingly, there is a 3 month lag to between the winds and the seasonality of the number of eddies, while the eddy amplitude responds approximately 6 months after the maximum winds. 
		\item Note that both coherent eddy amplitudes seem to peak around the same time. 
		\item If we look closely, the growing-shrinking concentric circles correspond to an increasing-decreasing trend. These are particularly obvious as a decrease in the eddy number in the Southern Hemisphere, and a increase in the eddy amplitude.

	\textbf{Should we add the interannual variability of Chelton's?}

	Overall, we observe a polewards decrease in the number of the eddies. This supports the idea that the satellite observations are consistent with a continue dataset.

	\section{Trends}

	\textbf{Figure 12}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The number and amplitude of coherent eddies from two eddy tracking algorithms show consistent trend patterns. 
		\item In particularly, we observe a decrease in the number of eddies in the southern ocean, as well as sectors in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. 
		\item Meanwhile the amplitude seems to be increasing in those same regions. 
		\item Some of these regions have undergone a readjustment to stronger winds, thus the observed trends in the eddy amplitude suggests an intensification of the coherent eddy field to an increase in the forcing.
		\item This increase is consistent with \citet{Martinez_Kinetic_2021}
